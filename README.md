# kasvu_scripts
Scripts for making statistics graphs for scout district membership growth committee/group/something.

These are really specific for use in Kuksa, Finnish Scout organization membership registry that is online. Because it doesnt have a API,
I needed to use Selenium to fetch member data with limits. I didnt want to do this manually since it would have meant hundreds of fetches.
